# ‚≠êÔ∏è Overview

Fleetbase is a comprehensive, open-source platform for the management and orchestration of logistics and supply chain operations. This dual-natured platform serves not only as an efficient operational tool for companies within these industries but also as a robust foundational layer for developers. Its versatility emanates from its core, which is skillfully constructed around a series of "extensions," creating a flexible and customizable framework that accommodates a wide spectrum of supply chain and logistics requirements.

Every individual extension within Fleetbase is purposefully engineered to fulfill specific roles within the expansive ecosystem of supply chain and logistics. With inherent extensibility users have the freedom to craft their own extensions, thereby expanding the ecosystem and ensuring the platform's adaptability across a multitude of use cases. This extensible nature ensures that Fleetbase remains at the forefront of meeting diverse logistical and supply chain needs now and into the future.

# üíæ Installation

Getting Fleetbase up and running on your system using Docker and Docker-compose is straightforward. Please follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that you have Docker and Docker-compose installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from their respective official websites:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_docker">Docker</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_docker_compose">Docker Compose</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Clone the Fleetbase repository to your local machine:
    <pre>bash git clone https://github.com/fleetbase/fleetbase.git</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigate to the cloned repository:
    <pre>cd fleetbase</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

### Build and Run Fleetbase

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Start the Docker daemon:</strong>
    Ensure the Docker daemon is running on your machine. You can either start Docker Desktop or either executed by running:
    <pre>sudo systemctl start docker</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Build the Docker containers:</strong>
Use Docker Compose to build and run the necessary containers. In the root directory of the Fleetbase repository, run:
  <pre>docker-compose up -d</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

### Access Fleetbase

Now that Fleetbase is up and running via Docker you can find the console and the API accessible:

<ul>
  <li>Fleetbase Console: <code>http://localhost:4200</code></li>
  <li>Fleetbase API: <code>http://localhost:8000</code></li>
</ul>

# üß© Extensions

Fleetbase extensions provide a powerful way to enhance and customize the functionality of Fleetbase to suit your specific needs. They are standalone modules that seamlessly integrate with Fleetbase's frontend and backend, allowing you to extend its capabilities.

### What are Fleetbase Extensions?
Fleetbase Extensions are built using both a backend PHP package and a frontend Ember Engine Addon. They are designed to blend seamlessly into the Fleetbase ecosystem, utilizing shared services, utilities, stylesheets, components, and template helpers.

### How do Extensions Work?
<ul>
  <li><strong>Backend</strong>: The backend of an extension is developed as a PHP package. This package should utilize the composer package `fleetbase/core-api`, which provides core API functionalities, making it easier to integrate your extension with Fleetbase's backend.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Engine</strong>: The frontend of an extension is built as an Ember Engine Addon. The Addon must require the packages `@fleetbase/ember-core` and `@fleetbase/ember-ui`. The `@fleetbase/ember-core` package provides core services and utilities that help to align your extension with Fleetbase's frontend. The `@fleetbase/ember-ui` package, on the other hand, supplies all the stylesheets, components, and template helpers needed to design a Fleetbase extension that seamlessly matches the look and feel of the Fleetbase UI.</li>
</ul>

### Building a Fleetbase Extension
To create a Fleetbase extension, follow these steps:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Backend PHP Package Creation</strong>: Begin by creating a backend PHP package. Make sure to use the composer package `fleetbase/core-api` to ensure smooth integration with Fleetbase's backend.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Frontend Ember Engine Addon</strong>: Next, you need to create the frontend of the extension using Ember Engine. Be sure to include the `@fleetbase/ember-core` and `@fleetbase/ember-ui` packages. These packages provide necessary services, utilities, and design components for aligning your extension with Fleetbase's UI.</li>

  <li><strong>Integrate Your Extension</strong>: Once you have the backend and frontend ready, you can integrate your extension into Fleetbase by installing it via the respective package managers. In the future you will be able to publish your extension to the Fleetbase extensions repository making it available to all instances of Fleetbase with the ability to even sell your extension.</li>
</ul>

With Fleetbase's modular architecture, you can develop your extensions to solve unique problems, enhance existing functionality, or add entirely new capabilities to your Fleetbase instance. This extensibility allows Fleetbase to adapt and evolve with your growing business needs.

# üì± Apps

Fleetbase offers a few open sourced apps which are built on Fleetbase which can be cloned and customized. Every app is built so that the Fleetbase instance can be switched out whether on-premise install or cloud hosted.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fleetbase/storefront-app">Storefront App</a>: Fleetbase based ecommerce/on-demand app for launching your very own shop or marketplace to Apple or Android playstore.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fleetbase/navigator-app">Navigator App</a>: Fleetbase based driver app which can be used for drivers to manage and update order, additionally provides real time driver location which can be viewed in the Fleetbase Console.</li>
</ul>
